# About

This works with the stops.txt file found within nl/gtfs-nl.zip on the OVapi website. This removes duplicate entries from stops, as each stop seems to have multiple GPS coordinates for entrances/exits and the middle of the station. This therefore converts the list into JSON while removing these duplicates to make it easier to use for general purpose applications.
